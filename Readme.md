I send quite a few letters and need to print addresses on envelopes to send them.

That's a tiny utility to do that.

It gets the from/to address from `mail.yml` and prints it on a C5 envelope.

P.S. When I changed my printer to HP M462dw, I had to modify the printing code a lot. So there's no guarantee it will work for you. It it prints in wrong places -- try to change printing attributes: the page orientation and the media size.

P.P.S. This repo has everything including the `.idea` files. That's to make it simpler to recover everything if needed. You may want to delete the `out` and `.idea` though.
